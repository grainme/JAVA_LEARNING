<h1>Packages</h1>
<p>A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes an interfaces.
    For instance, the standard class <strong>ArrayList</strong> is in the package <strong>java.util</strong>. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity.<br> Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.
  <br>To create package use this command

    ```bash
     javac -d directory javafilename
    ```

<p>A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. There're two forms of packages, built-in and user-defined packages.<br><li>Java packages provides access protection</li>
<li>Java package removes naming collision</li></p>
